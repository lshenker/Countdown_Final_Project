PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  The program will prompt the user for a countdown date. It will check if the 
  date entered is a date and if it has passed already or not. If it is a date 
  and has not passed then the countdown function will fun. If not, an error 
  message will be displayed. Then it will calculate the time difference between 
  the current time and the date entered. It will calculate the days, hours, 
  minutes, and seconds left until the countdown date entered and display the 
  values in real time. When the countdown is complete, a "countdown complete" 
  screen will be displayed.
